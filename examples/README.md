# TinyGPSPlusNF - Examples
All these examples are adapted from [Mikal Hart's examples (see TinyGPSPlus GitHub repo)](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus/tree/master/examples). All credit goes to him.

All solutions were created using .NET nanoFramework's `Blank Application` project template.

The examples using real hardware were tested on a NEO-6M gps module (GY-NEO6MV2) and an ESP32 board (NodeMCU-32S ESP-WROOM-32).
