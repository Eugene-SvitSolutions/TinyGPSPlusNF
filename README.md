# TinyGPSPlus for nanoFramework
This is a nanoFramework port of the TinyGPSPlus Arduino library. See [mikalhart's TinyGPSPlus github repo](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus) for an in-depth presentation of TinyGPSPlus.

This port is functionally identical to the original library. For now, there are no plans to add any new features.
